  Hey there, my name is Chirpy!

  Don't be alarmed :no_bell:, but i'm not a real person. I am just a little bird who's here to help!

  I'll send a brief greeting to each new staff member in this topic, welcoming them to the team and offering them a chance to experiment and discover how things work in our Forum. There's even a special prize for them at the end! :gift: Really!

  If you'd like to interact with me at anytime you can mention @chirpy anywhere in this private #staff category. Otherwise i'll stay out of your way and let you get on with your work.

  **Side note:** You can also send me a message and i'll respond to you :eyes:.

  I hope you like it! :heart: Anyways goodbye for now, i'll be around if you need me :wave: just mention @chirpy here in the #staff category.

tutorial_topic_ok: |
  I'm so glad you started this topic, because i absolutely love <%= data[:subject].pluralize %>!

  <%= dialogue("bot_likes_#{ data[:subject].downcase.singularize}") %>

tutorial_onebox: |
  Can you share a wikipedia link related to this topic? Try replying with **a link on a line by itself** and it'll automatically expand to include a handy summary!

  This also works for links from YouTube, GitHub, Twitter, Kickstarter, Soundcloud, WordPress and hundreds of other popular sites. But lets just stick with Wikipedia for now :smile:.

tutorial_onebox_ok: |
  Great! You've just created a "onebox"! :tada:

  This is a special feature of the forum that automatically expands links to provide a summary of the content. It's a great way to share information and keep the conversation flowing.

  I pressed the like :heart: button on your post to show my appreciation. :heart_eyes:

tutorial_picture: |
  Here's a picture of a <%= data[:subject] %>:

  <img src="/uploads/default/original/1X/ec5ab50b042f1c24757b9bab67871e352e881f7a.jpg" width="500" height="367">

  If you like it (and honestly who wouldn't?) just give me a :heart: and let me know.

  Hey, speaking of - **can you reply with a picture?** Anything will do! You can drag and drop, paste a link or use the upload button :smile:.

tutorial_picture_ok: |
  Wow, that's a great picture! :ok_hand:

  That step was pretty easy right? You can share images from your computer, phone, or the web. It's a great way to add some personality to your posts.

tutorial_formatting: |
  Now i'd like you to try adding some formatting to your post. Can you make some words **bold** and _italic_ in your reply!

  To format, you need to use Markdown, BBCode, HTML or if you're not into typing you can just push the buttons at the top of the editor :wink:!

  Here is a cheat sheet to get you started:
  - `**bold**` (Markdown)
  - `_italic_` (Markdown)
  - <b>bold</b> (HTML)
  - <i>italic</i> (HTML)
  - [b]bold[/b] (BBCode)
  - [i]italic[/i] (BBCode)

  If you are feeling adventurous there is a [formatting tutorial](http://commonmark.org/help) that you can check out (make sure you use something from it here though)

tutorial_formatting_ok: |
  Great! Posts look so much better when they're nicely formatted :ok_hand:.

  A little bit of formatting can go a long way to make your posts more **readable** and **engaging**.

tutorial_quote: |
  Alright, now things are getting a little more advanced. I'd like you to pick one of the quotes below:

  > If this is coffee, please bring me some tea; but if this is tea, please bring me some coffee.
  >
  > One advantage of talking to yourself is that you know at least somebody's listening.
  >
  > I want my children to have all the things I couldn't afford. Then I want to move in with them.

  Select one of the quotes above and use the quote feature to reply with it.

  If you need help with this step all you have to do is highlight the text you want to quote and press the "Quote" button that appears. It's that simple! :smile:

tutorial_quote_ok: |
  Great job! You've just quoted a post :clap:.

  Quoting is a great way to respond to specific points and keep the conversation organized. It's also a great way to give credit to the original author.

tutorial_emoji: |
  You may have seen me use these little pictures in my replies, like so: :cherries:

  Those are called "emoji" and they're a fun way to add personality to your posts. You can add them to your posts too!

  Go ahead and give it a try, reply to this message/post with your favorite emoji :eyes:

  Here are some ways you can add emoji to your posts:
  1. Type a traditional "smiley" like `:)` or `;)` or or `:D` and of course `:P`
  2. Type a colon `:` and then start typing the name of the emoji you want to use. A list of suggestions will appear as you type.
  3. Press the emoji toolbar button in the editor for a visual picker (mobile users can use their device's emoji keyboard).

  :race_car::dash: GO FOR IT!!!

tutorial_emoji_ok: |
  Great choice! :tada:

  Emoji are a fun way to add personality to your posts and keep the conversation light and engaging.

tutorial_mention: |
  Ever had a question for someone specific but aren't able to reply to them? That's where mentions come in!

  I'd like you to mention someone in your reply. Just type `@` and then start typing their username. A list of suggestions will appear as you type.

  Go ahead and give it a try now! Reply to this topic and mention me, @chirpy in your reply and i'll get notified.

tutorial_mention_ok: |
  Did someone say my name? :raised_hand: I believe you just did! :wave: 

  Mentions are a great way to get someone's attention and bring them into the conversation. They'll be notified that you mentioned them and can easily jump in and reply.

tutorial_link: |
  One handy way to refer to previous discussions is to link to them. To get a link to a reply or topic:
  - Use the link :link: button on the post
  - Copy the link from the address bar of your browser
  
  And you know what's _really_ cool? A link between two topics automatically works both ways, so anyone interested in either topic can easily follow all the linked topics too!

  Can you try pasting a link to my [welcome topic](/t/chirpy-introduction) in your next reply??

tutorial_link_ok: |
  Now that right there is some prime linkage chief :ok_hand:.

  Links are a great way to refer to previous discussions and keep the conversation flowing. They're also a great way to share information and keep the conversation moving.

tutorial_pm: |
  Sometimes you might want to have a private conversation with someone. You can do that by sending them a private message.

  I'd like you to send me a private message now. Select my avatar to expand the user card, then press the :envelope: Message button.

  I'll be waiting for your message :smile:.

  (Don't worry, i won't tell anyone what you say :shushing_face:)

  **Note:** You can also send me a message from my user page too, if you're into that sort of thing :wink:.

tutorial_pm_ok: |
  Hey, i just got your personal message :mailbox_with_mail:.

  Thanks i'll reply to you there too :+1:.

  Private messages are a great way to have one-on-one conversations with other members of the community. 
  
  They're also a great way to share information and keep the conversation flowing.

tutorial_pm_reply: |
  My very own private message? For _me?_ :blush: Awe you shouldn't have! :upside_down_face:

        ______ _                    _
      (_) |  | |                  | |
          |  | |     __,   _  _   | |
        _ |  |/ \   /  |  / |/ |  |/_) 
        (_/   |   |_/\_/||/  |  |_/| \_/

              __         |
      |   | /  \_|   |  |
        \_/|/\__/  \_/|_/o
          /|
          \|

  You can also add multiple people to a PM to make it a group PM, as needed (but don't go overboard :wink:).

  No need to reply to this, but please know that i will always treasure our correspondence :heart:.
